 * Pull a prompt from the hub.
 *
 * @param ownerRepoCommit The name of the repo containing the prompt, as well as an optional commit hash separated by a slash.
 * @param options.apiKey LangSmith API key to use when pulling the prompt
 * @param options.apiUrl LangSmith API URL to use when pulling the prompt
 * @param options.includeModel Whether to also instantiate and attach a model instance to the prompt,
 *   if the prompt has associated model metadata. If set to true, invoking the resulting pulled prompt will
 *   also invoke the instantiated model. For non-OpenAI models, you must also set "modelClass" to the
 *   correct class of the model.
 * @param options.modelClass If includeModel is true, the class of the model to instantiate. Required
 *   for non-OpenAI models. If you are running in Node or another environment that supports dynamic imports,
 *   you may instead import this function from "langchain/hub/node" and pass "includeModel: true" instead
 *   of specifying this parameter.
