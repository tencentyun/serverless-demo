     *
     * There are some variations in different ECIES implementations:
     * which key derivation function to use, compressed or uncompressed `senderPoint`/`sharedPoint`, whether to include `senderPoint`, etc.
     *
     * Because the entropy of `senderPoint`, `sharedPoint` is enough high[1], we don't need salt to derive keys.
     *
     * [1]: Two reasons: the public keys are "random" bytes (albeit secp256k1 public keys are **not uniformly** random), and ephemeral keys are generated in every encryption.
     *
     * @param pk - Receiver's public key.
     * @param compressed - (default: `false`) Whether to use compressed or uncompressed public keys in the key derivation (secp256k1 only).
     * @returns Shared secret, derived with HKDF-SHA256.
