Spanner dialect for SQLAlchemy
==============================

Spanner dialect for SQLAlchemy represents an interface API designed to
make it possible to control Cloud Spanner databases with SQLAlchemy API.
The dialect is built on top of `the Spanner DB
API <https://github.com/googleapis/python-spanner/tree/master/google/cloud/spanner_dbapi>`__,
which is designed in accordance with
`PEP-249 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`__.

Known limitations are listed `here <#features-and-limitations>`__. All
supported features have been tested and verified to work with the test
configurations. There may be configurations and/or data model variations
that have not yet been covered by the tests and that show unexpected
behavior. Please report any problems that you might encounter by
`creating a new
issue <https://github.com/googleapis/python-spanner-sqlalchemy/issues/new>`__.

-  `Cloud Spanner product
   documentation <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs>`__
-  `SQLAlchemy product documentation <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`__

Samples
-------------

The `samples directory <https://github.com/googleapis/python-spanner-sqlalchemy/blob/-/samples/README.md>`__
contains multiple examples for how to configure and use common Spanner features.


A Minimal App
-------------

Database URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to connect to a database one have to use its URL on connection
creation step. SQLAlchemy 1.3 and 1.4 versions have a bit of difference
on this step in a dialect prefix part:

.. code:: python

   # for SQLAlchemy 1.3:
   spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id

   # for SQLAlchemy 1.4 and 2.0:
   spanner+spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id

To pass your custom client object directly to be be used, create engine as following:

.. code:: python

    engine = create_engine(
        "spanner+spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id",
        connect_args={'client': spanner.Client(project="project-id")},
        isolation_level="SERIALIZABLE"
    )

Create a table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   from sqlalchemy import (
       Column,
       Integer,
       MetaData,
       String,
       Table,
       create_engine,
   )

   engine = create_engine(
       "spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id"
   )
   metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)

   user = Table(
       "users",
       metadata,
       Column("user_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
       Column("user_name", String(16), nullable=False),
   )

   metadata.create_all(engine)

Insert a row
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   import uuid

   from sqlalchemy import (
       MetaData,
       Table,
       create_engine,
   )

   engine = create_engine(
       "spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id"
   )
   user = Table("users", MetaData(bind=engine), autoload=True)
   user_id = uuid.uuid4().hex[:6].lower()

   with engine.begin() as connection:
       connection.execute(user.insert(), {"user_id": user_id, "user_name": "Full Name"})

Read
~~~~

.. code:: python

   from sqlalchemy import MetaData, Table, create_engine, select

   engine = create_engine(
       "spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id"
   )
   table = Table("users", MetaData(bind=engine), autoload=True)

   with engine.begin() as connection:
       for row in connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall():
           print(row)

Migration
---------

SQLAlchemy uses `Alembic <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/#>`__
tool to organize database migrations.

Spanner dialect doesn't provide a default migration environment, it's up
to user to write it. One thing to be noted here - one should explicitly
set ``alembic_version`` table not to use migration revision id as a
primary key:

.. code:: python

   with connectable.connect() as connection:
       context.configure(
           connection=connection,
           target_metadata=target_metadata,
           version_table_pk=False,  # don't use primary key in the versions table
       )

As Spanner restricts changing a primary key value, not setting the ``version_table_pk`` flag
to ``False`` can cause migration problems. If ``alembic_versions`` table was already created with a primary key, setting the flag to ``False`` will not work, because the flag is only applied on table creation.    

Notice that DDL statements in Spanner are not transactional. They will not be automatically reverted in case of a migration fail. Also Spanner encourage use of the `autocommit_block() <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/api/runtime.html#alembic.runtime.migration.MigrationContext.autocommit_block>`__ for migrations in order to prevent DDLs from aborting migration transactions with schema modifications.

| **Warning!**
| A migration script can produce a lot of DDL statements. If each of the
  statements is executed separately, performance issues can occur. To
  avoid it, it's highly recommended to use the `Alembic batch
  context <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/batch.html>`__
  feature to pack DDL statements into groups of statements.

Features and limitations
------------------------

Interleaved tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Cloud Spanner dialect includes two dialect-specific arguments for
  ``Table`` constructor, which help to define interleave relations:
  ``spanner_interleave_in`` - a parent table name
  ``spanner_inverleave_on_delete_cascade`` - a flag specifying if
  ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` statement must be used for the interleave
  relation
| An example of interleave relations definition:

.. code:: python

   team = Table(
       "team",
       metadata,
       Column("team_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
       Column("team_name", String(16), nullable=False),
   )
   team.create(engine)

   client = Table(
       "client",
       metadata,
       Column("team_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
       Column("client_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
       Column("client_name", String(16), nullable=False),
       spanner_interleave_in="team",
       spanner_interleave_on_delete_cascade=True,
   )
   client.add_is_dependent_on(team)

   client.create(engine)

**Note**: Interleaved tables have a dependency between them, so the
parent table must be created before the child table. When creating
tables with this feature, make sure to call ``add_is_dependent_on()`` on
the child table to request SQLAlchemy to create the parent table before
the child table.

Commit timestamps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dialect offers the ``spanner_allow_commit_timestamp`` option to
column constructors for creating commit timestamp columns.

.. code:: python

   Table(
       "table",
       metadata,
       Column("last_update_time", DateTime, spanner_allow_commit_timestamp=True),
   )

`See this documentation page for more details <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/commit-timestamp>`__.

Unique constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud Spanner doesn't support direct UNIQUE constraints creation. In
order to achieve column values uniqueness, UNIQUE indexes should be used.

Instead of direct UNIQUE constraint creation:

.. code:: python

   Table(
       'table',
       metadata,
       Column('col1', Integer),
       UniqueConstraint('col1', name='uix_1')
   )

Create a UNIQUE index:

.. code:: python

   Table(
       'table',
       metadata,
       Column('col1', Integer),
       Index("uix_1", "col1", unique=True),
   )

Autocommit mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spanner dialect supports ``SERIALIZABLE``, ``REPEATABLE_READ``, and
``AUTOCOMMIT`` isolation levels. ``SERIALIZABLE`` is the default
isolation level.

``AUTOCOMMIT`` mode corresponds to automatically committing each
insert/update/delete statement right after is has been executed.
Queries that are executed in ``AUTOCOMMIT`` mode use a single-use
read-only transaction. These do not take any locks and do not need
to be committed.

Workloads that only read data, should use either ``AUTOCOMMIT`` or
a read-only transaction.

Isolation level change example:

.. code:: python

   from sqlalchemy import create_engine

   eng = create_engine("spanner:///projects/project-id/instances/instance-id/databases/database-id")
   autocommit_engine = eng.execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")

Automatic transaction retry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In ``SERIALIZABLE`` isolation mode, transactions may fail with an ``Aborted`` exception.
This happens if there are conflicts between different transactions, for example if one
transaction tries to read data that another transaction has modified. Aborted transactions
should be retried by the client. The Spanner SQLAlchemy provider automatically retries
aborted transactions.

Isolation level ``SERIALIZABLE`` takes lock for both **reads and writes**.

Use isolation level ``REPEATABLE READ`` to reduce the amount of locks that
are taken by read/write transactions. ``REPEATABLE READ`` only takes locks
for **writes** and for queries that use a ``FOR UPDATE`` clause.

Auto-increment primary keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spanner uses IDENTITY columns for auto-increment primary key values.
IDENTITY columns use a backing bit-reversed sequence to generate unique
values that are safe to use as primary values in Spanner. These values
work the same as standard auto-increment values, except that they are
not monotonically increasing. This prevents hot-spotting for tables that
receive a large number of writes.

`See this documentation page for more details <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/schema-design#primary-key-prevent-hotspots>`__.

Auto-generated primary keys must be returned by Spanner after each insert
statement using a ``THEN RETURN`` clause. ``THEN RETURN`` clauses are not
supported with `Batch DML <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/dml-tasks#use-batch>`__.
It is therefore recommended to use for example client-side generated UUIDs
as primary key values instead.

Query hints
~~~~~~~~~~~

Spanner dialect supports `query
hints <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/query-syntax#table_hints>`__,
which give the ability to set additional query execution parameters.
Usage example:

.. code:: python

   session = Session(engine)

   Base = declarative_base()

   class User(Base):
       """Data model."""

       __tablename__ = "users"
       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
       name = Column(String(50))


   query = session.query(User)
   query = query.with_hint(
       selectable=User, text="@{FORCE_INDEX=index_name}"
   )
   query = query.filter(User.name.in_(["val1", "val2"]))
   query.statement.compile(session.bind)

Read-only transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, transactions produced by a Spanner connection are in
ReadWrite mode. However, workloads that only read data perform better
if they use read-only transactions, as Spanner does not need to take
locks for the data that is read; for these cases, the Spanner dialect
supports the ``read_only`` execution option, which switches a connection
into ReadOnly mode:

.. code:: python

   with engine.connect().execution_options(read_only=True) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

See the `Read-only transaction sample
<https://github.com/googleapis/python-spanner-sqlalchemy/blob/-/samples/read_only_transaction_sample.py>`__
for a concrete example.

ReadOnly/ReadWrite mode of a connection can't be changed while a
transaction is in progress - you must commit or rollback the current
transaction before changing the mode.

Stale reads
~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the Spanner `Stale
Reads <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads#perform-stale-read>`__
with SQLAlchemy you can tweak the connection execution options with a
wanted staleness value. For example:

.. code:: python

   # maximum staleness
   with engine.connect().execution_options(
       read_only=True,
       staleness={"max_staleness": datetime.timedelta(seconds=5)}
   ) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

.. code:: python

   # exact staleness
   with engine.connect().execution_options(
       read_only=True,
       staleness={"exact_staleness": datetime.timedelta(seconds=5)}
   ) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

.. code:: python

   # min read timestamp
   with engine.connect().execution_options(
       read_only=True,
       staleness={"min_read_timestamp": datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 17, 12, 55, 30)}
   ) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

.. code:: python

   # read timestamp
   with engine.connect().execution_options(
       read_only=True,
       staleness={"read_timestamp": datetime.datetime(2021, 11, 17, 12, 55, 30)}
   ) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

Note that the set option will be dropped when the connection is returned
back to the pool.

Request priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to use Request Priorities feature in Cloud Spanner, SQLAlchemy provides an ``execution_options`` parameter:

.. code:: python

   from google.cloud.spanner_v1 import RequestOptions

   with engine.connect().execution_options(
       request_priority=RequestOptions.Priority.PRIORITY_MEDIUM
   ) as connection:
       connection.execute(select(["*"], from_obj=table)).fetchall()

DDL and transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DDL statements are executed outside the regular transactions mechanism,
which means DDL statements will not be rolled back on normal transaction
rollback.

Dropping a table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cloud Spanner, by default, doesn't drop tables, which have secondary
indexes and/or foreign key constraints. In Spanner dialect for
SQLAlchemy, however, this restriction is omitted - if a table you are
trying to delete has indexes/foreign keys, they will be dropped
automatically right before dropping the table.

Data types
~~~~~~~~~~

Data types table mapping SQLAlchemy types to Cloud Spanner types:

========== =========
SQLAlchemy Spanner
========== =========
INTEGER    INT64
BIGINT     INT64
DECIMAL    NUMERIC
FLOAT      FLOAT64
TEXT       STRING
ARRAY      ARRAY
BINARY     BYTES
VARCHAR    STRING
CHAR       STRING
BOOLEAN    BOOL
DATETIME   TIMESTAMP
NUMERIC    NUMERIC
========== =========

Other limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  WITH RECURSIVE statement is not supported.
-  Temporary tables are not supported.
-  Numeric type dimensions (scale and precision) are constant. See the
   `docs <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/data-types#numeric_types>`__.

Best practices
--------------

When a SQLAlchemy function is called, a new connection to a database is
established and a Spanner session object is fetched. In case of
connectionless execution these fetches are done for every ``execute()``
call, which can cause a significant latency. To avoid initiating a
Spanner session on every ``execute()`` call it's recommended to write
code in connection-bounded fashion. Once a ``Connection()`` object is
explicitly initiated, it fetches a Spanner session object and uses it
for all the following calls made on this ``Connection()`` object.

Non-optimal connectionless use:

.. code:: python

   # execute() is called on object, which is not a Connection() object
   insert(user).values(user_id=1, user_name="Full Name").execute()

Optimal connection-bounded use:

.. code:: python

   with engine.begin() as connection:
       # execute() is called on a Connection() object
       connection.execute(user.insert(), {"user_id": 1, "user_name": "Full Name"})

Connectionless way of use is also deprecated since SQLAlchemy 2.0 and
soon will be removed (see in `SQLAlchemy
docs <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/connections.html#connectionless-execution-implicit-execution>`__).

Running tests
-------------

Spanner dialect includes a compliance, migration and unit test suite. To
run the tests the ``nox`` package commands can be used:

::

   # Run the whole suite
   $ nox

   # Run a particular test session
   $ nox -s migration_test

Running tests on Spanner emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dialect test suite can be run on `Spanner
emulator <https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator>`__. Several
tests, relating to ``NULL`` values of data types, are skipped when
executed on emulator.
